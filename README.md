# install-packages

Installs the common packages and applies configurations I frequently apply to vanilla Debian/Ubuntu systems:

* Installs NodeJS from third-party (nodejs.com)
* Installs Google Chrome from third-party (Google)
* Adds: Rust, ARM cross-compiler and debug tools.
* Removes libimobiledevice as the repo versions are usually out of date.
* Applies my personalised [VIM preferences](https://github.com/dgrubb/vim-config).
