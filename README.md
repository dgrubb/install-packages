# install-packages

Installs the common packages and applies configurations I frequently apply to vanilla Debian/Ubuntu systems:

* Installs NodeJS from third-party (nodejs.com)
* Installs Google Chrome from third-party (Google)
* Adds dev tools: cmake, build-essential, g++, Rust, ARM cross-compiler, debug tools, Git, Subversion, libtool, pkg-config.
* Add utilities: vlc, aircrack, tmux, vim, terminator, handbrake, SSH server, Android tools.  
* Removes libimobiledevice as the repo versions are usually out of date and best compiled from source.
* Applies my personalised [VIM preferences](https://github.com/dgrubb/vim-config).
